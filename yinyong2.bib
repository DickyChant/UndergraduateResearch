The weak point of the Bayes approach, namely the need of the knowledge of the initial distribution, can be overcome by an iterative procedure. Since the method proposed here does not make use of continuous variables, but simply of cells in the spaces of the true and of the measured quantities, it can be applied in multidimensional problems."

We find that in this model v2{4}, elliptic flow determined from 4-particle cumulants, exactly equals the average flow value in the reaction plane coordinate system, 〈vRP〉, the relation which, in an approximate form, was found earlier by Bhalerao and Ollitrault in a more general analysis, but under the same assumption that v2 is proportional to the initial system eccentricity. We further show that in the Gaussian model all higher order cumulants are equal to v2{4}. Analysis of the distribution in the magnitude of the flow vector, the Q-distribution, reveals that it is totally defined by two parameters, v2{2}, the flow from 2-particle cumulants, and v2{4}, thus providing equivalent information compared to the method of cumulants. The flow obtained from the Q-distribution is again v2{4}=〈vRP〉."
